# HIOK03451U Language Processing 2 exam

My exam for the Language Processing 2 course at University of Copenhagen, Spring 2016. The original task was to run some parses on BitPar PCFG parser, evaluate the results, implement two developments with head-child, and lexical transformations of the rules, and test the effect of these two developments on the performance of the parsing task.

I composed my work in [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_Programming) style, in Jupyter Notebook and Python, using NLTK and Pandas libraries. The data for the assignment was the Wall Street Journal corpus of the [Penn Treebank](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/). The parser used was Schmid's [BitPar](http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/BitPar/), and for evaluation we were instructed to use [EVALB](http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/evalb/).

The course was teached by JÃ¼rgen Wedekind, and is part of the [IT & Cognition Master's Programme](http://studies.ku.dk/masters/it-and-cognition) at University of Copenhagen.
